id="speechblocks:K-0509/1"><hr class="segment" sentence_id="sentences:398803"><span class="speaker">CHARLES THOMPSON:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398803">This is Charlie Thompson on January 20, 2000 at 1:10 PM with Billy Ray Hall who is the President of the North Carolina Rural Center.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398804">Mr. Hall will you tell us what your present position is here is at the Center and also something about your work as director with the hurricane re-development center.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/2"><span class="speaker">BILLY RAY HALL:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398805">Sure.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398806">The Rural Economic Development Center was created in 1987.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398807">Mr. Bill Friday and others and said we needed a long-term look at the rural economy of this state and we needed an organization who would have as its mission to promote the long-term economic development of rural North Carolina with a special focus on low income individuals.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398808">So as a typical non-profit we've been at it for thirteen years and we've become a bit atypical in the sense that we've run economic programs funded by national foundations, funded by the private sector, and most recently significant funding by the public sector.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398809">We administer part of the clean water bond issue, passed by the citizens of North Carolina last year, or year before last.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398810">We also administer micro-enterprise loan program at a level around two million, funded by the Ford Foundation, and we get about eight million a year from the General Assembly to administer.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398811">So while we're a non-profit, we're a fairly significant non-profit in doing research and capacity building in rural areas.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398812">And so we've been doing that for thirteen years.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398813">Most recently thought, the Governor asked me to come over on loan, which I agreed to do, to head up his re-development effort following hurricane Floyd.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398814">Now I did this on loan from the Center three years ago when we followed up hurricane Fran.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398815">This time the request was for me to come over and head up a re-development office which would basically do three or four things.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398816">First, we would try to understand the degree and the depth of the damage that was done by this hurricane.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398817">Second, we would pursue the public and private resources needed to redevelop our rural areas, including state funds as well as federal funds.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398818">And then lastly, we would look at long-term re-development of an area that had just substantial devastation.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398819">And I'm doing that now with a staff of seven, to undertake those activities.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398820">If you segregate our job, it really means that we put together an initial federal request to go to Congress on last fall.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398821">We were successful there in getting roughly a billion dollars committed to the effort here in North Carolina.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398822">Then we put together a request for state funding and we were successful in getting 836 million dollars to deal with the hurricane.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398823">And now we're hard at work putting together the next federal request to go to Congress, sometime in the next few weeks, and we're also helping to roll out the state programs that were approved by the general assembly.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398824">And in addition to that, we sort of coordinate all the folks that are doing different things under the hurricane.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398825">We bring them all together and make sure we're doing a concerted and a cooperative effort to bring as much relief and as much potential re-development as we can to the eastern part of the state.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398826">My term of duty is about eight months long to the state, which will run through June 30.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398827">Fortunately or unfortunately, I keep doing the other job to, so I've got two jobs right now.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/3"><hr class="segment" sentence_id="sentences:398828"><span class="speaker">CHARLES THOMPSON:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398828">Right.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398829">You're mostly likely I think from rural North Carolina?</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/4"><span class="speaker">BILLY RAY HALL:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398830">I'm from eastern North Carolina, the heart of pickle country, which is Mt. Olive, a town of 4600.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398831">It was 4600 when I was born in 1948 and in the last census it was around 4600 so it's a typical eastern town with a railroad track down the middle and about 60 percent majority and 40 percent minority population.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398832">So, that's where I come from--this is my accent.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/5"><span class="speaker">CHARLES THOMPSON:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398833">And did Mt. Olive get flooded?</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/6"><span class="speaker">BILLY RAY HALL:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398834">No.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398835">Mt. Olive is nine miles south of Goldsboro.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398836">Goldsboro is the city, like most cities, that grew up around our rivers.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398837">And Goldsboro sits on the Neuse River--it was significantly flooded both by hurricane Floyd and previously by hurricane Fran.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398838">So, some of my kin people were living in the area were flooded, but not me.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398839">In fact, I had a second cousin that was killed going to work in Goldsboro.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398840">So this disaster, besides all the other attributes, got very personal very fast.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/7"><span class="speaker">CHARLES THOMPSON:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398841">Describe Governor Hunt's process that he went through to appoint you to this position.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/8"><span class="speaker">BILLY RAY HALL:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398842">Well, Governor Hunt's process probably has as a byproduct appointing me, his process is to, as he has done for the fifteen years he's been Governor, first and second times he's served as Governor, his focus has been to understand government and what it can do for people.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398843">Can you hold for just a second--.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/9"><span class="sentence" id="sentences:398844">The Governor's experience at dealing with hurricanes and disaster, I think, is probably the most significant thing in terms of positioning this state's leadership to respond to a hurricane of the magnitude of Floyd.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398845">He immediately went into the disaster office, and by knowledge of state government and how it operates, we did immediate responses that were obviously very fast.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398846">And when you contrast the Governor of North Carolina sitting in that office at 1 AM making calls to dispatch National Guard to respond to various floods, and you contrast that with other state's where governor's are on vacation during a disaster, it gets to be very obvious the difference.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398847">And not that that the way it's obvious, what's more obvious is his degree of involvement in the process.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398848">Immediately we were responding appropriately in terms of emergency response.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398849">He then new from experience, and the way I got involved in the task, it was not going to be enough money in normal federal programs of disaster to speak to this size of disaster.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398850">The housing money they make available is temporary housing, it doesn't deal with long-term recovery.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398851">The assistance to the farm community is based on a one-time event of a small nature rather than substantial resources to deal with large disasters.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398852">So I came on board to help address what's not going to be normally in the package of available response in the public system.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398853">And he knew that I knew how to do that, because I had done it before for him.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/10"><span class="speaker">CHARLES THOMPSON:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398854">For another hurricane?</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/11"><span class="speaker">BILLY RAY HALL:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398855">For hurricane Fran.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398856">I did the re-development effort under hurricane Fran also.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398857">We were able to go get federal money and put together a state response package and improve the way we respond to disasters after Fran that a lot of people say helped us a great deal in getting ready for this disaster.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398858">The redevelopment effort now picks up that speed, and with the Governor's leadership, we pursue resources whether at the federal and then putting the state package together, which we did.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398859">His comfort with me doing the analysis and then his expectation that we package that with outreach to various groups.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398860">He and I plan and think a lot alike, so allows me to do that work for him and get it to him.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398861">That's how I got there, it's not because he just happened to think of me or I was available--it's because that's where my experience was for the last twenty-seven years, I've done rural economic development work.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398862">In his previous administration I was a deputy secretary for natural resources and community development agency and have been doing economic develop--, rural economic development work all my entire career.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398863">So, I was ready to go.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398864">Here I am back again.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/12"><span class="speaker">CHARLES THOMPSON:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398865">Well, let's talk about the flood itself.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/13"><span class="speaker">BILLY RAY HALL:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398866">Sure.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/14"><hr class="segment" sentence_id="sentences:398867"><span class="speaker">CHARLES THOMPSON:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398867">What are the effects of the flood as you describe them?</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/15"><span class="speaker">BILLY RAY HALL:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398868">I think anytime you start talking about numbers they are only understandable when you put them in relation to something.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398869">For example, if you say you had a hundred dollars worth of damage and you're in a developing nation where you house costs 150 dollars and is made out of natural materials, it's a lot different than in America when you have a hundred dollars worth of damage.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398870">So the first thing to do is let's put perspective.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398871">This was a six billion dollar disaster in North Carolina.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398872">The entire agriculture output for the state of North Carolina last year was seven billion dollars.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398873">So six billion dollars is huge relative to this state's economy, relative to our resource base.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398874">And that is big by any stretch of the imagination--60,000 homes being damaged, 17,000 are uninhabitable and 7,000 are totally destroyed.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398875">So you get really huge numbers to go along with the fifty-one people who are actually--, lost their lives.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398876">And you begin to get a feel for the size.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398877">The second thing to look at is in the agricultural community--we lost 190 million dollars of cotton in the fields that were flooded.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398878">In addition, we lost over 300 million dollars of other crops in the field for a total of 538 million dollars worth of crops that were washed away.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398879">Now, if that wasn't bad enough for the farmer the farm community in eastern North Carolina lost 281 million dollars worth of structures, equipment, like tractors and combines that were flooded and washed out, washed away in some cases, barns that were destroyed.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398880">So they lost not just the 581 million dollars in crops, they lost another 281 million dollars in structures and equipment, plus they had the damage to their land--literally, thirty to fifty million dollars worth of damage to their land.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398881">Another sixty-five million dollars worth of damage to their waterways and stuff, where trees were in the creeks and stuff.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398882">So, looking at the scale of disaster it just boggles your mind at the scale that was playing itself out.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398883">If you want to take it down to a specific case, FEMA, which is a national flood response agency, has been around for about twenty years.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398884">In that twenty years with all the disasters you and I have heard about throughout the last twenty years, they've actually had destroyed properties that they helped acquire with the local resources of about 20,000 units of property--21,000 to be exact.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398885">In this flood in North Carolina they will assist us in acquiring 11,000 structures, so we're going to acquire in one disaster, in one period of time, more than half the amount of structures that have been acquired.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398886">And we remember TV scenes of the Midwest floods and the earthquakes in the west and we think, "Well, wow, they were huge." What I'm telling you is by size this is as big a natural disaster for a state as has been experienced in America.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398887">And that plays its way out.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398888">The third perspective to put on these numbers, and this is what a lot of people forget, we in the South and particularly in eastern North Carolina have a lot of poor people.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398889">Those poor people by force of circumstance moved to the cheaper land they end up being along the creeks which are the flooded areas, they're in low-income housing and they're sitting there with low wealth.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398890">And when this flood came, it struck those people primarily.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398891">An example, Princeville is a town of 700 home--2100 people--all seven hundred were flooded.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398892">Seven of them had flood insurance in the whole town.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398893">O.K. Now 80 percent of that town is classified as in poverty--80 percent of those homes are classified as living in poverty.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398894">That's less than around $20,000 for a family of four.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398895">And what that tells you is, that this is a disaster that sucked away a lot of our resource base, a huge impact on our farming and business community, but also devastated an already poor population.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398896">And plays it way out all the way down.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398897">So, the third perspective I would put on is, that this disaster was very non-selective in the sense of it being a disaster.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398898">On the other hand, because we have moved people around those creeks, primarily minorities and primarily low income, that's who took the brunt of this--the least stable, the least insured.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398899">So, it's been terrible.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398900">That's the best way I can describe it.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398901">And when you work your way out of there, we need very badly to get probably close to three billion dollars worth of assistance from the federal government to have even a chance of recovering from this six billion dollar disaster.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398902">We've got about two billion so far headed our way or targeted for North Carolina.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398903">We still have to win it in competition with other states.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398904">And we've got about 800 million dollars worth of support out of the state, or a little over 830 million.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398905">We will still need another billion, in my mind of this effort, to make it work and then we're still short.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398906">I mean you still have a long way to go.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/16"><span class="speaker">CHARLES THOMPSON:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398907">That still doesn't make up for the seven billion.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/17"><span class="speaker">BILLY RAY HALL:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398908">Well, you want to put it another context, tobacco took its third--, we were in the crop season and it was roughly eighty or ninety million dollars worth of tobacco still in the field--it was flooded, destroyed.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398909">But that was the second year for the farmer who, three years earlier, was farming at X amount in two years he took a thirty-five percent reduction in quota.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398910">This year we're in now, he had disaster strike him and take his tobacco crop, and now he's got a reduction in quota again.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398911">So, the farmer is the one, if I had to guess, in a terms of a way of life, farming is the most at risk as a way of life for being lost in major areas of rural North Carolina.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/18"><hr class="segment" sentence_id="sentences:398912"><span class="speaker">CHARLES THOMPSON:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398912">So, really the eastern part of the state was already under siege economically and so forth--it's a huge challenge for your Center I'm sure.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/19"><span class="speaker">BILLY RAY HALL:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398913">Well, the rural Center, ironically, was producing a report that was to look at the good and the difficult in rural North Carolina.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398914">And the good was about the growth around our urban areas and some of our other areas like Wilson and Greenville, that seemed to be digging their way into or up to a better economy.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398915">But it was also talking about places left out which a lot of eastern North Carolina was.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398916">Which meant that they really had a long way to go and then you hit them with a double blow--a disaster on top of bad farming.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398917">And so it's a tough story to put in perspective, but it's also a challenge that we can't walk away from because their part of our state, their part of our potential.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/20"><span class="speaker">CHARLES THOMPSON:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398918">Right so the flood has helped fine tune the efforts of the Center?</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/21"><span class="speaker">BILLY RAY HALL:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398919">Helped fine tune a lot of efforts.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398920">The Rural Center, obviously, we're focused very tightly now on some major responses to eastern North Carolina and trying to look at the disaster as a way of not only focusing on those problems, like the need for water and sewer and information technology and others, but also as an opportunity to say, "OK if we're going to go in an rebuild let's at least rebuild correctly, let's do it smart or smarter." Let's also take advantage of at least the public focus, the Erskine Bowles Commission that just been faced--, looking at rural development issues, it fed in very well.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398921">So, if you're going to have a disaster, certainly, if you wanted public attention focused the national attention from the governors, press, to the--, just the national media looking at a disaster, all the way down to just good timing, if there can be such a thing, around the disaster.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398922">A lot of ideas were on the table and cooking.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398923">And so I think it's a good opportunity.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398924">I mentioned earlier wearing two hats with the Rural Center and the disaster recovery.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398925">I also have a third hat.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398926">The tobacco settlement created the North Carolina Tobacco Foundation and I serve on that Foundation that's chaired by Mr. Friday and we worked together to create this Rural Center.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398927">And so we have an opportunity there to focus their attention while we're focusing the state and national attention.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/22"><hr class="segment" sentence_id="sentences:398928"><span class="speaker">CHARLES THOMPSON:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398928">You said, "Let's do it correctly, let's do this"--, can you describe what some of those efforts would be?</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/23"><span class="speaker">BILLY RAY HALL:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398929">Correctly, means that when you're in a community that's growing slowly and let's say you're learning as you go.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398930">In other words, first of all, you're diversifying out of agriculture and so you're learning your way into a small manufacturing base and you just put it wherever you can.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398931">You're limited planning background and planning professionals as a small community, so you really don't avail yourself of say long range planning and defining flood plains and getting flood maps.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398932">You develop infrastructure as the growth takes place, so you follow rather than shaping the growth by placing the infrastructure in.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398933">And in eastern North Carolina we've done, I think, a very good job of following some opportunities.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398934">Now the problem is you don't need to follow some opportunities to have smarter growth, you need to lead opportunities.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398935">You need to decide this is a good area for industrial growth and you need to build the industrial support structure.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398936">Similarly, you need to look at hazardous areas and get out of them.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398937">It would have been great had we had strong professional planning and understanding among the citizenry about the danger from floods and understood it and not developed in those flood plains.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398938">Those 11,000 units of property are going to cost over 440 million dollars of public money to acquire--they would have been much better had they been built outside those flood plains and not flooded with this disaster.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398939">And so, I think, whether it's looking at infrastructure and planning for the development of a community, this time have the benefit of, hopefully, to lead opportunities or lead in terms of the growth of the area with a lot better knowledge.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398940">It also pointed out some problems.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398941">For example local governments, like a lot of us, when it's not a problem you really don't pay a lot of attention to it.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398942">Most of our flood plain maps that drive the discussion locally about what you should and shouldn't do, are over twenty years old.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398943">And you got a twenty-year-old flood plain map--the guy builds his house with good intentions, he's not in a flood plain, he's not required to have insurance, so I don't have insurance--I bet you don't.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398944">A five hundred year flood comes along it not only gets his house, it gets the guy's a half-mile away higher--because this was a five hundred year flood.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398945">Had it been a hundred-year flood though it still would have got those houses, because they probably weren't drawn correctly.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398946">You pour as much cement in Wake County and Durham and Johnston County as we've poured in the last ten years, and I'll guarantee you there's a lot more water hitting the Neuse river right now than there was ten years ago.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398947">Now, thankfully, we've got the Falls of the Neuse, but still a five-hundred year flood event made it very clear--Falls of the Neuse will not stop a twenty inch rain storm from flooding huge areas of eastern North Carolina.</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/24"><hr class="segment" sentence_id="sentences:398948"><span class="speaker">CHARLES THOMPSON:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398948">A lot of the highways follow those bodies--, those rivers and creeks as well, right?</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/25"><span class="speaker">BILLY RAY HALL:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398949">We had a thousand roads closed during this disaster.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398950">We had three inter-states that were affected, two that were closed--sections of inter-state highway, roads that were washed completely out.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398951">But we learned.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398952">One, that water is incredibly powerful: whether it washes a car off the road as it did when the eighteen inches of water washes a vehicle off and kills the family of a highway patrolman, or whether it's the water that's rising and cutting out the highway and instead of driving off in a bump, it's a forty foot hole that's been washed out of the highway.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398953">So we learned some pretty valuable lessons.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:398954">The other thing we learned with eight communities on the

id="sentences:399046">Right.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399047">I've heard a lot about the FEMA representatives as I've traveled around, and some of those have been sensitive and some haven't.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399048">And some people are very dissatisfied with how FEMA has calculated the amount of loan or grant that they are going to get.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399049">Will state people go back in behind those federal people?</span> </p><p class="speechblock" id="speechblocks:K-0509/47"><span class="speaker">BILLY RAY HALL:</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399050">Well, first of all, most of the FEMA people are working with a state counterpart in one way or another.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399051">Now the reason why the people are dissatisfied is a lot of things that we naturally take for granted are not necessarily true when you are doing a response to a disaster.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399052">First of all, you expect people to understand you, to be comfortable talking to you.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399053">And what you do in a disaster if you are a federal agency with only 2,500 employees, 2,500 I believe nationwide, is they have a huge number of employees that are on call--they come in just for disasters and help do this work.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399054">Now they generally do very good work but they may have a bad day plus an accent and for most of us in the South that does not go down well, and so everything--, given you're in a disaster and you're already having real problems and frustrations, now you got a person across the desk that doesn't sound like you.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399055">You know, that irritates the system.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399056">There is some of that.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399057">The other part is just the reality.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399058">People make personal judgments about how much damage there is to your house.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399059">When that guy comes out to fix it and tells you what the price is, you got a problem sometimes.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399060">And what we do is, first of all, we appeal within the existing system.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399061">We have an individual advocate program that's created within the emergency management program.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399062">If you feel like you've been had or taken advantage of or treated wrong, you are open--, there is a number for you to call to protest.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399063">And then they are to investigate on your behalf.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399064">They are your advocate with the system.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399065">Now the system sometimes responds, sometimes you end up appealing up ladders.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399066">That happens.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399067">That is very frustrating to a person that's living in a trailer with two other members, or two other groups of a family.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399068">And so, I understand that.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399069">You know, like I said I've got family that were flooded and they're just as mad as anybody else.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399070">And I've got a brother--, I guess a nephew-in-law, that is very upset at the appraisal they put on his damage.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399071">Now what we're doing is on case by case, we're handling those.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399072">But where we see a broad range of issues beginning to emerge we develop a state response.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399073">We're now meeting with the federal agencies to say, "There are some inconsistencies emerging here, we need to sit down and figure out what's causing this inconsistency.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399074">Two houses next to each other, three feet of water, one has a much higher level of damage estimated, two different folks estimating and we're seeing this too many times in this area." And so we're sitting down with the federal folks and dealing with those in blocks.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399075">Generally, it's on an individual basis, but if we can detect a consistent, or inconsistency, in an area, we'll raise that with the federal folks and go sit down a try to resolve that.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399076">The bad news is, it takes time.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399077">And for the person that's frustrated, they're just twice as frustrated.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399078">And the scary thing for a lot of people is if you don't hurry up and get some response their going to move.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399079">If you ship your children off to Raleigh or to Virginia or to New York to live with kin people while you try to survive in FEMA city, in a eight by twenty mobile home, how long are your children going to be up there and you're trying to get to work in an area without a home and you're waiting for a response.</span> <span class="sentence" id="sentences:399080">How long can you wait?
