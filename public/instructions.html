<h3>What you are doing</h3>
<p>You are curating an online collection of oral history interviews. Because the interviews are long enough that most people would not want to listen to them in their entirety, you must select shorter excerpts that are easier to consume in one sitting.</p>
<p>An excerpt should cover a single topic or anecdote and should be understandable on its own. Someone with only a general sense of who is being interviewed and what the interview is about should be able to listen to the excerpt without feeling that he or she is missing some important piece of context.</p>
<p>Excerpts may vary in length. On average they will be around 30-50 sentences long. But some could be an order of magnitude shorter or longer (3 to 500 sentences).</p>
<p>Not everything in an interview needs to be excerpted. Use your judgment to select excerpts that capture the most important parts of the interview.</p>
<p>To get a sense of what appropriate excerpts look like, you can take a look at this <a href="/example.html">example</a> of a transcript from which a set of useful excerpts have been selected (see the next section for an explanation of what the gray and red horizontal and vertical lines indicate).</p>

<h3>Selecting excerpts</h3>
<p>To select excerpts, you must first break up the transcript into segments, and then indicate which segments you want to select as excerpts.</p>
<p>You should notice that sentences are highlighted in yellow as you move the mouse pointer over them. Clicking a sentence will insert a break (indicated by a horizontal gray line) before that sentence in the transcript. Clicking on a break will remove it.</p> 
<p>When you insert a break, you will see a vertical gray line appear in the margin to the left of the transcript. This vertical gray line indicates the extent of the segment you've created. If there are no breaks between the break you've created and the end of the transcript, the segment will extend from your new break to the end of the transcript. Otherwise the segment will extend to the next break.</p>
<p>To select a segment as an excerpt, click the vertical gray line to the left of the segment. It should turn red, indicating that you have selected that segment as an excerpt. Note that it is possible select consecutive segments as excerpts, if you choose to do so.</p>

<p>So, to select an excerpt:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the first sentence in the excerpt you wish to select, thus inserting a break before it.</li>
<li>Then, click on the sentence <em>after</em> the last sentence in the excerpt (unless you want the excerpt to extend to the end of the transcript).</li>
<li>Finally, click the vertical gray line to the left of the segment to select it as an excerpt.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Saving your work</h3>
<p>Your segments and excerpts are automatically saved as you work. If you close your web browser, when you next open the annotation tool you will be taken to the last transcript you worked on. To indicate that you are done selecting excerpts from a transcript and move on to the next one, click the "Mark as Done" button at the bottom of the transcript. <strong>Be careful not to click this button before you are done, as you will not be able to return to a transcript that you have marked as done.</strong>
